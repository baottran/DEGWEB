<p>CCC ONE labor is built from the “outside in”, meaning that the labor associated with replacing an inner part (i.e. front apron) does not, by default, automatically include the labor associated with any related outer part that must first be removed and later reinstalled (i.e. fender). Still, for many common operations, such as replacing a radiator support or quarter panel, this program includes much of associated labor required for the operation. Your understanding of exactly what is and is not included is essential to your ability to write an accurate estimate. If you choose to question a labor value which you feel may by inaccurate (Submit a Database Inquiry), you must first understand what is included and not included in that value.</p>

<p>There are two places to go for the answer to this question. The first place where you may find a labor note for a given operation in your CCC ONE estimating system is in the Footnote. The labor note may tell you what specific related items are included within that labor value (i.e. includes R&I of radiator, condenser, headlamps and cooling fan), or it may tell you what specific items are not included and must be selected separately (i.e. after removal of headlamps). You must pay close attention to these notes during the preparation of the estimate. If the estimate has been generated by another person, you may need to have the generator of the estimate pull up those labor notes and share them with you or copy them into a manual line note on an estimate line so they appear on the body of the estimate. Labor notes that you are unaware of or that you choose to ignore, may result in inaccurate estimates that fail to capture all labor operations associated with the repair.</p>

<p>The second place that tells you what is, by default, included and not included in a given operation, is the MOTOR Guide to Estimating. If you have a photographic memory and are able to memorize the pages within the guide, you are well on your way to writing a quality estimate. For the rest of us, the Guide to Estimating must be alongside us at all times and constantly referenced. If you are still unsure if a needed operation is included or not included, you can always select that operation. If it is included, “INCL” will be displayed. If it is not included, a labor value will appear or the field will be blank. A blank labor field indicates that the associated labor is not included, but MOTOR has not assigned a labor value to this part and you may need to manually insert an appropriate labor value.</p>

<p>The MOTOR Guide to Estimating can be accessed within the CCC ONE program by selecting the “Guide” tab in the upper right hand corner above the graphic. Alternatively, the most current printable version can be accessed online within the CCC website, or you can click here for the direct link to the MOTOR Guide to Estimating or the MOTOR Recycled Assemblies Guide to Estimating.
Important estimate symbols to remember:</p>

<p>Line Note- The letter (N) on an estimate line indicates that a line note written by the estimate preparer applies to that operation. That note may indicate a variety of things that the estimate preparer wanted to communicate about that particular line. These notes are automatically printed on the estimate below the estimate lines.</p>

<p>Line Override – An asterisk (*) on an estimate line indicates that the default database labor or description associated with that operation has been altered by the estimator. To highlight what portion of that line has been overridden an underline will appear below the changed portion of the line. In the case of labor or dollar overrides, it is critical that you understand what the value was originally, and why that value was altered. A common example of this is altered refinish time, which may or may not be valid.</p>

<p>Manual Entry – A pound sign (#) indicates that the line has been manually entered by the estimate preparer.</p>
