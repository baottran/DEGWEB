		The Database Enhancement Gateway (DEG) is an initiative that was developed to help improve the quality and accuracy of collision repair estimates, through proactive feedback from the collision repair industry and other "end users" to the Information Providers (IPs) that supply the databases for the various estimating products. The DEG is created, equally funded and maintained by the Automotive Service Association (ASA), the Alliance of Automotive Service Providers (AASP) and the Society of Collision Repair Specialists (SCRS).</p>

   <p>Issue Summary The database is saying .3 and it just seems half of what it should be. Resolution From Audatex A/C line labor consists only of the basic connect and disconnect of the line. The Audatex labor does not account for additional tasks that may be needed for the actual placement of the line through the vehicle. Most manufacturers do not offer a service procedure for this operation and the vehicles can differ depending on options and drive trains. The actual placement of the lines remain an estimate on sight operation using a manual entry.</p>
