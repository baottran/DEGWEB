<p>Dear DEG Users: We are a small non-profit that helps the collision industry correct the deficiencies or problems in our estimating systems database. We have only 1 full time administrator and several volunteers but help over 28,000 registered collision shops in the US and like any other business we have costs: servers, this website, software and the administrator. The DEG is the only non-profit organization that helps the collision industry with these database issues so we are quite unique. We do not charge users to submit an inquiry or to view our large database of previous inquiries, our services are free. We receive our funding from the three largest automotive organizations in the US: AASP, ASA and SCRS. We also receive sponsorships from organizations and individuals. If you would like to help the DEG you can donate any amount by clicking the link below or by mailing a check directly to the DEG.
